  <h1 class="h1">Circular Economy</h1>

  <h5 class="h5">
    A Europe-wide EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy and annex to transform the way plastics and plastics products are designed, produced, used and recycled. By 2030, all plastics packaging should be recyclable.
    <br>
    <br>
    To achieve its ambitious vision, the Strategy foresees actions to improve the economics and quality of plastic recycling; to curb plastic waste and littering; to drive investments and innovation; and to harness global action. To reduce the leakage of plastics into the environment, the Commission has also adopted a new proposal on Port Reception Facilities, to tackle sea-based marine litter and published a report on the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic, including oxo-degradable plastic carrier bags, on the environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    A Communication on options to address the interface between chemical, product and waste legislation that assesses how the rules on waste, products and chemicals relate to each other.
    <br>
    <br>
    A Monitoring Framework on progress towards a circular economy at EU and national level. It is composed of a set of ten key indicators which cover each phase – i.e. production, consumption, waste management and secondary raw materials – as well as economic aspects – investments and jobs - and innovation.

  <h5>
    The modern idea of regenerative and responsible product design, typified by the concept of the circular economy, stems from a number of whole system design concepts. Influences on this concept come from renowned architect Walter R Stahl, sustainability pioneer Gunter Pauli and Natural Step founder Karl-Hendrik Robért, to name a few.
    <br>
    <br>
    Amongst the influences on the concept are the criteria outlined in the Hannover Principles, published in 1991, compiled and written by architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart, the founders of Cradle to Cradle®. The principles are a set of statements about designing buildings and objects with forethought about their environmental impact, their effect on sustainable growth and their overall impact on society.
    <br>
    <br>
    The circular economy is a relatively new system of operation, which aims to ‘close the loop’ and design waste out of the system. This means a transition from the outdated ‘take, make, dispose’ linear operating model, which is highly wasteful and detrimental to the environment, to a more responsible all-encompassing and abundant resource management system. This current system mines resources, uses them in the manufacturing of a product and then disposes of these valuable materials at the end of use; usually to landfill or incineration, meaning a large amounts of resource value is lost. On the other hand, the circular economy closes this resource loop by providing a system of operation that designs wastage out of the system, avoiding landfills and incineration altogether and keeping resources in use for as long as possible through reuse and regeneration of new products.
    <br>
    <br>
    This circular economy is a vital system to facilitate reduction in the depletion of resources. For example, a “circular” designed phone would be one that is designed for disassembly at the end of use, made with approved high-quality materials that can be safely re-utilised, either into another phone or other suitable products. The reuse of resources include their reclamation by the original manufacturer for use in new products, allowing manufacturers substantial financial savings. This activity retains material value and dramatically reduces undesirable ecological impacts.
