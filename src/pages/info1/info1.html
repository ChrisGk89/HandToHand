    Feed Hungry People is the second tier of EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy. In 2015, over 39 million tons of food was generated in the United States. While Americans dispose of millions of tons of food, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 11.8 percent of American households - about 15 million households - had difficulty providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources at some time during 2017.1 In many cases, the food tossed into our nation’s landfills is wholesome, edible food.
